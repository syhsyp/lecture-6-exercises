# Create a list "meals" that has contains your breakfast and lunch
meals <- list(breakfast, lunch)
# Add a "dinner" index to your "meals" list that has what you plan to eat for dinner
meals[[3]] <- "dinner"
# Extract your 'dinner' element from your list and save it in a vector called 'dinner'
### Bonus ###
